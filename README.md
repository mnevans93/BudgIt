# BudgIt - An app for tracking your expenses!

## <u>Introduction</u>
BudgIt is a personal project of mine, designed to replace budget spreadsheets I've created with a simple web app that allows you to track transactions on your various accounts, whether they are bank accounts or credit cards, to help provide short and long-term overviews of your financials. BudgIt is not set up to connect to your bank or credit card company directly, and as such, it will not pull data directly from those accounts.
